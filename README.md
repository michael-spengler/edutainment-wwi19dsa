This is an edutainment repository for a general overview regarding different and backand frameworkds

For this educational and advisory video I focused on giving some basic explanation what frameworks are for, 
which are the most known ones and how they differ in regards to their usecase.

This video is really beginner friendly and does therefore not contain too much code! This is taken on purpose since
it is supposed to catch the viewer before any other actions than an idea of the Project and it's scope have taken place.
I am focusing on discussing pro's and con's of diffrrent well known back- and frontend frameworks. 


(Edit regarding the Overview graphic even for Vue you have component based programming when developing, but it feels less restraining in the case of Vue since Angular gives you more strict to follow guidlines on how to implement components and code it is overall less flexible than Vue in regards to structure.)
